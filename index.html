          <h2>About Me</h2>
           I am a 7 year United States Army veteran. in the military I spent my whole 7 years in Fire Support. Fire support is where I would call in artillery fire and close air supports on a given location to help protect our troops in contact. It was an awesome experiece to be in the military. I joined the military right after High-school.
           If I had to make any changes to my life as of right now I would say, I wouldn't change serving in the military but just the places I got stationed after my deployments. I was stationed in Fort Riley, Kansas from 2007 to 2012. After my two deployments with the Big Red One. I got stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington. I had the option of 3 places and I chose to return home. So if I could change my decision I would of chose going overseas to Germany and explore all of Europe. 
           
           I am married to the most beautiful wife and have been for 10 years now. I have 1 son who is 5 years old. Together we create the most perfect family. we have two dogs and one cat.
