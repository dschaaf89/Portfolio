    <h2>Background </h2>
      <p>
        My background is in the Military and Outside Sales. I worked as a Door-to-Door Salesman the last 3 years for Comcast where I picked up interpersonal relationship building skills. Most of my work background though is centered around the military and the work etihc that the military instilled in me. The drive, being able to self motivate and ability to adapt and overcome any problem presented at the current moment and achieve success is what i contribute to my time in the military.</p>

          Education
        </h3>
        <p>
          Because I chose to go the military right after high-school, I have not finished a degree path yet.
          I almost have my <span style="font-weight: bold;">Associates in Science with emphasis in Computer Science</span>. I chose to pursue a program in programming becuase I have always liked coding from my times in high-school to a job as a program analyst. I plan to pursue a Software development position after taking this programing course, and to finish up my schooling with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
