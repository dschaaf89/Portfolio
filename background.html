    <h2>Background </h2>
      <p>
        My background is in the Military and Outside Sales. I worked as a Door-to-Door Salesman the last 3 years for Comcast. picked up interpersonal relationship building skills from my time with Comcast. most of my work background though is centered around the military and the work etihc that the military instilled in me. The drive,motivating and ability to adapt and overcome any problem presented at the current moment and achieve success is what i contribute to my time in the military.
